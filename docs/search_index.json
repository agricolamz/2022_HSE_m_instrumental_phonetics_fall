Phonetics is generally assumed to be a subfield that deals with articulatory, acoustic and perceptional aspects of phonological units. Phonology and phonetics together are supposed to describe organization of sounds in languages. This course is about acoustic phonetics. 2.3 Simple Harmonic Motion Periodic Motion is any type of motion that repeats itself after successuve equal time intervals. Simple Harmonic Motion is specific type of periodic motion that arises from existence of some equilibrium position for a described object; linear restoring force that tending to pull the described object back to its equilibrium position. There are several parameters of wave: Amplitude (A) is the maximum displacement of the equilibrium position (quick note: this value is always positive). Period (T) is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event. Measured in seconds. Frequency (f) is the number of period (cycles) per second. Measured in Hz. \\[ f = \\frac{1}{T} \\] \\[ T = \\frac{1}{f} \\] We can correlate the physical properties of sound waves with our perception: We perceive changes in frequency as pitch; We perceive changes in amplitude as loudness. One period of SHM can be devided into 360° of phase φ. So for the case of two SHM they can be out of phase: … or one way can be 90° ahead: So after all we have everything important for the wave definition: \\[ s(t) = A \\times \\cos(2\\pi ft + \\phi) \\] A — amplitude; f — is the fundamental frequency; φ — phase; t — time. 2.4 Addition of waves If we add some waves, we will get the new wave: Beats — beats is a phenomenon of the change in amplitude of the sum of two waves with slightly different frequencies. Here is an example from Wikipedia. 2.5 Harmonics 2.6 Fourier Transform Fourier Transform allows to extract components of the complex wave. smoothie complex wave ↓ ↓ 1 banana, cut in chunks 300 Hz 1 cup grapes 1000 Hz vanilla yogurt 1/2 apple, cored and chopped 1.5 cup fresh spinach leaves Spectrograms are differ in window length: Syllable [ka] Conventional spectrogram and Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution of the English word had, computed using a Kaiser tapering function (Fulop 2011: 119): Conventional and reassigned spectrograms of the English word right (Fulop 2011: 42): 2.7 Source-Filter Model of Speech Production The output energy (at the mouth) for a given frequency is equal to the amplitude the source harmonic, multiplied by the magnitude of the filter function for that the frequency. 2.8 Summary sounds are waves (with amplitude, frequency and phase) simple waves can be combined to the complex one Fourier transform allows to extract components of the complex wave It is not only Fourier transform that allows to extract components of the complex wave Source-Filter Model: vocal tract is a resonator that filters some frequencies of the wave produced by vocal folds vibration.

Historically, height and backness are impressionistic linguistic terms: But we are intersted just in a cardinal points: If we analyze acoustics we can get something like this: i a u F1 300 700 300 F2 2300 1400 800 However, if we analyze real sounds it could be messy: Tube model, after (Fant 1960b): vocal tract is a tube or a set of tubes: 3.1.3 Wavelength \\[c = \\frac{\\lambda}{T} = \\lambda\\times f \\approx 33400\\text{ cm/s}\\] c — speed of sound; λ — wavelength; f — sound frequency; T — period. Neutral vocal tract in the position for the vowel ə: Resonance is a phenomenon in which a vibrating system or external force drives another system to oscillate with greater amplitude at specific frequencies.

However, see the more detailed overview in (Flynn 2011). There are three possible sources of variation in vowel formants measurements (P. Ladefoged and Broadbent 1957; Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973: 1095; Adank 2003): acoustic variation; speaker variation; sociolinguistic; anatomical/physiological variation; and measurement error (“residual variance” in (Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973)). There are a lot of researchers aimed to reduce speaker-related variation using acoustic vowel normalization (e. g. (Gerstman 1968; Lobanov 1971; Syrdal and Gopal 1986)). However there are some researches that afraid that normalization procedures can reduce interesting for the linguistics information like sociolinguistic/dialectal signal in data (Hindle 1978; Disner 1980; Thomas 2002, 174–75). Human listeners deal seemingly effortlessly with all three possible sources of variation, but the dataset from (Peterson and Barney 1952) shows extrordinary variation: 3.2.1 Acoustic vowel normalization procedures There are several classes of vowel normalization procedures: formant-based procedures (Gerstman 1968; Lobanov 1971; Fant 1975; Syrdal and Gopal 1986; Miller 1989); whole-spectrum procedures (Klein, Plomp, and Pols 1970; Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973; Bladon and Lindblom 1981; Bladon 1982; Klatt 1982); Neural networks (D. J. M. Weenink 1993; D. Weenink 1997). Formant-based procedures are the most compact (just 2- or 3-dimensional represetations) and comparable crosslinguisticaly. In (Adank 2003) author compared 11 methods of vowel normalization: abb method 1 HZ the baseline condition, formants in Hz 2 LOG a log-transformation of the frequency scale 3 BARK a bark-transformation of the frequency scale 4 MEL a mel-transformation of the frequency scale 5 ERB an ERB-transformation of the frequency scale 6 GERSTMAN Gerstman’s (1968) range normalization 7 LOBANOV Lobanov’s (1971) z-score transformation 8 NORDSTRÖM &amp; LINDBLOM Nordström &amp; Lindblom’s (1975) vocal-tract scaling 9 CLIH i4 Nearey’s (1978) individual log-mean procedure 10 CLIH s4 Nearey’s (1978) shared log-mean procedure 11 SYRDAL &amp; GOPAL Syrdal &amp; Gopal’s (1986) bark-distance model 12 MILLER Miller’s (1989) formant-ratio model 3.2.2 (Lobanov 1971) z-score transformation The idea behind the Lobanov’s method is simple z-normalization. Imagine some random distribution: If we apply the folowing normalization, the distribution form will be the same, however the scale will be unified with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1: \\[x_{normalized} = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\] library(phonTools) data(pb52) pb52 %&gt;% group_by(speaker) %&gt;% mutate(vowel = ipa::convert_phonetics(vowel, from = &quot;xsampa&quot;, to = &quot;ipa&quot;), scaled_f1 = scale(f1), scaled_f2 = scale(f2)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(scaled_f2, scaled_f1, label = vowel, color = vowel))+ stat_ellipse()+ geom_text()+ scale_x_reverse()+ scale_y_reverse() You can find implementation of other methods in R package vowels.

So, the semivowels are characterized acoustically by formants. But they are consonantsǃ Occur on the periphery of syllables, and not in the centers or nuclei of syllables: Russian дай [daj] ‘give’ vs. English die [daɪ] English yo-yo [’jəʊjəʊ] vs. Russian йо-йо [jo’ʝo] But: Russian театр [tʲi’atr] vs [tʲi’atr̥]/[tʲi’atər] ‘theatre’ English button [’bʌtn] Mande languages ŋ ‘I’ 4.2.1 Semivowels: ʋ, w, j, ɥ, ɰ Since articulation of those vowels is really similar to corresponding vowel the spectrum will be simmilar: ʋ, w — u j — i ɰ — ɨ ɥ — y 4.2.2 Semivowels: w, ɥ French Louis [lwi] ‘Louis’ vs. lui [lɥi] ‘him’ 4.2.3 Semivowels: ɹ, ɻ Those semivowels are produced by raising the tongue toward the alveolar ridge, the tip does not touch the alveolar ridge. The acoustic results of these tongue tip adjustments are particularly obvious in the third formant: F3 falls below the F3 frequencies typical of the neighboring vowels. 4.3 Nasal Stops The greater surface area of the vocal tract means that the walls of the vocal tract absorb more energy than in non-nasal sounds, and the greater volume of air means that the inertia of air within the vocal tract absorbs more sound as well. 4.3.1 Nasal Stops: uvular ɴ When the uvula is lowered and the dorsum of the tongue raised to produce an uvular nasal, the vocal tract can be described as a uniform tube that is closed at the glottis and open at the nostrils.If we know the length of the tube, we can calculate its resonant frequencies, because this is a quarter-wave resonator (like the vocal tract configuration for schwa). (Fant 1960b): 12.5 cm (the distance from the uvula to the nares) + 9 cm (the distance from the uvula to the glottis) ≈ 21.5 cm F1 = c/4L = 35000/4*21.5 = 407 Hz F2 = 3c/4L = 1221 Hz F3 = 5c/4L = 2035 Hz F4 = 7c/4L = 2849 Hz Since there is a velocity maximum at the nostrils each of the resonant frequencies will be lower. It is hard to make quantitative predictions about the formant frequencies of ɴ (the shape of the nasal passage varies), but the formant values will be spaced more closely in the uvular nasal than they are in ǝ 4.3.2 Nasal Stops: m 4.3.3 Nasal Stops: anti-resonance The main difference between ɴ and m is that the mouth cavity forms a side branch in the resonant tube. The mouth cavity can be modeled as a tube closed at one end (the lips) and open at the other (the uvula) , with a length of about 9 cm. We can therefore calculate the resonances of the mouth cavity as we did for ǝ, ɴ: c/4L = 35,000 / (4 × 9) = 972 3c/4L = 2,917 Hz The resonant frequencies of the mouth cavity in nasals are not like that we’ve seen before: the mouth cavity is a side branch of a larger resonantor: it doesn’t open directly to the atmosphere. They are “absorbed” in the side branch anti-resonance the frequency components in m that are near the resonant frequencies of the mouth cavity are canceled, and become (anti-formants) in the acoustic output. Formants show up in the spectrum as peaks of sound energy, and anti-formants show up as pronounced spectral valleys. 4.3.4 Nasal Stops: the main properties low F1 (sometimes called the “nasal formant”), close spacing between formants, the presence of anti-formants, whose frequencies are determined by the place of articulation 4.4 Laterals Laterals could be analised in the similar way: a small pocket of air on top of the tongue acts as a 4cm side branch (to the main acoustic channel which curves around one or both sides of the tongue) produce anti-formants in the spectrum (≈ 2,125). 4.5 Nasal, nasalised, and prenasalised vowels The most complicated configuration of the vocal tract: 2 resonant systems at once: the pharynx cavity + the mouth cavity — the oral tract – has resonances at about 500 Hz, 1,500 Hz, and 2,500 Hz; the pharynx cavity + the nasal cavity — the nasal tract – 400, 1,200, 2,000 Hz. All these formants are present in the spectrum of nasal vowels. Of course, the resonant frequencies of the oral tract can be modified by movements of the tongue and lips, constriction of the nose at the nares. For nasalised/prenasalised vowels closed mouth produced antiformants (680 Hz, 2040 Hz). 4.6 Seminar 4.6.1 Glides vs. Vowels Periodic voicing Amplitude lower then in vowels Formants First Formant target is lower than vowels’ First Formant target Open quotient1 (= First Harmonic - Second Harmonic) is lower for glides 4.6.2 Liquids Periodic voicing Amplitude lower then in vowels Formants Wide average spacing of the formants 4.6.3 Nasal Stops Acoustics Periodic voicing Amplitude lower then in vowels Formants Formants have broad bandwidths Low frequency first formant Less space between formants Higher formants have low amplitude Antiformants 4.6.4 Spectral Slices Praat Objects &gt; Open Sound View &amp; Edit Find the middle of nasals or one cycle Spectrum &gt; View Spectrum slice (Ctrl+L) Select Spectrum Slice object in Praat Object window Praat Objects &gt; Draw… We can use the following file with Andic nasals.

Thus, the proportion of time that the glottis is open (the open quotient) during each cycle is 0.5. Creaky voice — the vocal folds are held together loosely, and air bubbles up through them. This cause longer closed phase of the glottal period and a comparably shorter open phase (and thus a smaller open quotient). Breathy voice — the vocal folds vibrate, but without much contact (for some people the vocal folds do not completely close during breathy voicing). So the glottis is open for a relatively long portion of each glottal cycle. A device called an artificial larynx is often used as a prosthesis for patients who have had their larynx removed due to disease. A device called an artificial larynx is often used as a prosthesis for patients who have had their larynx removed due to disease. A — the closed vocal folds produce a glottal stop ʕ B — the air forced through the closed vocal folds produce creaky voice C — air can go through vocal folds without extra pressure, making them vibrate, this is called modal voice D — high rate of airflow makes vocal folds vibrate even if they are slightly pulled apart (breathy voice) E — pulling the vocal folds further apart doesn’t allow them vibrate, the result is a voiceless sound F — pull the vocal fold further apart, this is called aspiration In (Peter Ladefoged 1971) it is suggested that there might be a continuum of phonation types from most open to most closed: voiceless &gt; breathy &gt; modal &gt; creaky &gt; glottal closure 5.2.1 Breathy phonation example As a consequence of noise in breathy phonation, there is much more aperiodic energy across the spectrum and the formant structure is less clear (Gordon and Ladefoged 2001): Spectrograms of modal and breathy voiced nasals in the Jalapa Mazatec words /nthǽ/ ‘seed’ and /ndǽ̰/ ‘horse’ (female speaker) 5.2.2 Creaky phonation example Creaky phonation is characterized with irregular glottal periods (jitter) but with clear formant structure. As a consequence of this irregularity, F\\(_0\\) is not (usually) calculated so accurately. 5.3 Obstruents For obstruents the articulators form constrictions and occlusions within the vocal tract that generate aperiodic noise as the airflow passes through obstructions: much more restricted airflow; acoutically, little or no of formant structure 5.3.1 Torbulence The main factors that determine whether airflow is turbulent: the size of the channel and the volume velocity of the airflow (volume of air going past a certain point per unit time). If 100 cm\\(^3\\) per second of air flows through a channel, turbulent airflow is created if the channel area is less than 10 mm\\(^2\\) , but not if the channel area is 20 mm\\(^2\\) . It’s easier to get turbulent airflow from a narrow straw than a wide one. 5.3.2 Fricatives sibilant are most intensive fricatives vs. non-sibilant for sibilants the constriction between the alveolar ridge, or in the postalveolar area and the tip of the tongue, or the blade of the tongue a second constriction between the upper and lower incisors must be narrow so that the airstream is directed over the edges of the teeth, creating turbulent airflow behind the teeth for non-sibilants noice is not so prominent, hardly audible This diagram shows the results for some models of velar and palatal consonants compared to a single tube model of a neutral vowel. (adapted from (Fant 1960b: 73)) 5.3.3 Stops The main articulatory posture during a stop is complete closure of the vocal tract, acoustically silence. However, languages use a great variety of stops, utilizing different places of articulation, stop release sounds, and accompanying noises. Different places of articulation are destinguishable because of the coarticlulation with vowels. See the following picture from (Obleser et al. 2010): 5.3.4 Voiced Onset Time (VOT) This notion was introduced in (Lisker and Abramson 1964), very influential work: Picture 5.1: picture from www.connectedpapers.com VOT is the timing of glottal pulsing relative to supraglottal articulation Picture 5.2: A graphical representation of the VOT of voiced, tenuis, and aspirated stops, Wikipedia (Abramson and Whalen 2017) argue that VOT is a cross-linguistically useful (and simple) measure, even if not a universal discriminator. aspirated voiced in Hindi: pʰ, p, b and bʰ. – both latter sound types show negative VOT, bH showing breathy voice filling before the onset of modal voice) pre-aspirated in Swedish, Icelandic, Scots Gaelic and Tarascan – period of aspiration preceding a silent CD Korean: unaspirated, slightly aspirated and strongly aspirated (degree of VOT) Considering a sample of languages, (Cho and Ladefoged 1999) show that VOT measurements do not directly depend on sound

perception This lecture was recorded. During the course we almost completely was focused on a Acoustic Phonetics ignoring Articulatory and Auditory Phonetics. Auditory phonetics focuses on hearing of speech signals; perception of speech signals. 7.1 Hearing During the hearing acoustic waves are transformed into nerve impulses that are perceived by the brain. This process is described in this Wikipedia video. Picture 7.1: Blausen.com staff (2014). “Medical gallery of Blausen Medical 2014”. WikiJournal of Medicine 1 (2). DOI:10.15347/wjm/2014.010. ISSN 2002-4436 The peripheral auditory system translates acoustic signals into neural signals; performs amplitude compression; performs a kind of Fourier analysis. 7.2 Perception of speech signals There is no one to one connections between physical properties of sounds and their auditory sensations. However during the experiments we can reveal how they are connected: amplitude or intensity — loudness; fundamental frequency — pitch; spectral structure — sound quality; duration – length. 7.2.1 Non-acoustic factors influencing perception People use a lot of different things in order to decode what have been said: context; when part of an utterance is replaced by another sound (e.g. white noise), listeners perceptually restore the missing speech. [Warren (1970); Samuel (1981); and many others]; knowledge of linguistic units (Ganong effect, (Ganong 1980)); and their frequency?.. visual signal: McGurk Effect. 7.2.2 Psychoacoustic scales An equal-loudness contour (Fletcher and Munson 1933) is a measure of sound pressure level, over the frequency spectrum, for which a listener perceives a constant loudness when presented with pure steady tones. Picture 7.2: Manoochehr Darvish, 2015, DOI:10.14279/depositonce-4409 Loudness historically was described with sone and phone scales, but the most popular now is A-weighting: The same idea for perception of frequency if proposed in Bark scales: 7.2.3 Categorical perception https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd9Z4dZ1OSs References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
